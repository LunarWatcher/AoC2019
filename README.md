# Advent of Code 2019

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019), written in C++.

If it doesn't work (and is supposed to), make sure the input file is dos2unix'd first. The Linux VM doesn't handle the \r and I'm too lazy to implement a patch when I canc just dos2unix instead.
